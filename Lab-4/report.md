# Weather Data Visualizer Report

## Introduction
This project studies real weather data and finds useful patterns. 
I analyzed temperature, humidity, and rainfall using Python.

## Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values  
- Converted date column  
- Selected useful columns  

## Statistics
I calculated:
- Mean temperature
- Min/Max values
- Monthly Averages

## Visualizations
I created:
- Line chart for daily temperature  
- Bar chart for monthly rainfall  
- Scatter chart for humidity vs temperature  
- Combined chart  

## Insights
- Temperature trends show daily fluctuations.
- Rainfall is higher in certain months.
- Humidity increases when temperature is low/high (as visible in scatter plot).

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
